# RPyG

RPyG is a role playing game entirely in the tty terminal. It is written in python.

## Installation

You can clone this repository and run the game with:

```sh
poetry run python main.py
```

Or just 

```sh
python main.py
```

(However the latter method is not perfered as it might break without warning in future updates.)
