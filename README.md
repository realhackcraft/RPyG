# RPyG

RPyG is a role playing game entirely in the tty terminal. It is written in python.

## Installation

You can clone this repository and run the game with:

```shell
poetry run python main.py
```

Or just 

```shell
python main.py
```

(However the latter method is not perfered as it might break without warning 
in future updates.)

You can also fork this game on [replit](https://replit.com/@realhackcraft/RPyG)
and run it there.

## Compatibility

Compatibility with old or budget systems is our topmost priority. We are using
the terminal to ensure maximum backwards compatibility for computers without 
graphical capabilities. If you can run shell commands, you can probably play
this game too.

## Roadmap

### Gameplay

We want to improve this game by adding a storyline, NPCs, saving and more maps
to the game. Please also leave feedback in the community discussion area and 
report any bugs!

### Technology
We plan on porting our game to more performant languages like C or C++ for less
overhead on slow computers.
